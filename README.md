# SQL - Challenge
# Data Engineering Project at Pewlett Hackard

## Background

Welcome to the Data Engineering Project at Pewlett Hackard! As a new data engineer, your first major task is to perform a research project on the employees hired during the 1980s and 1990s. Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company, has provided you with six CSV files containing data from that period.

## Data Modeling

Inspect the CSV files to understand the data fields and their relationships.

Sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables using a tool like QuickDBD, to visualize the relationships between different tables.

## Data Engineering

Use the information from the data modeling step to create table schemas for each of the six CSV files.

## For each table:

Specify the appropriate data types for each column.
Define primary keys to uniquely identify each row.
Implement foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
Create the tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys properly.
Import the data from each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis

Once the database is set up, you can perform data analysis by executing specific queries on the database. The following queries will be performed:

List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

List the first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.

List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

List the department number for each employee along with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List the first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and last name begins with the letter B.

List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all employee last names to determine how many employees share each last name.

## Project Completion

By the end of this project, you will have completed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis tasks. You will have a well-organized SQL database with properly designed tables, containing historical employee data, and will be able to answer specific questions about the employees at Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s.
